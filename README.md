# **🕶️ ShadowWallet – Advanced Cryptographic Analysis Suite**  

## 🔥 **Core Features**  
**1. Private Key Bruteforce Module**  
- GPU-accelerated search for weak BIP39 seed phrases (12/24 words).  
- Custom dictionaries (language packs, leaked password databases).  
- Pattern detection for common mnemonic errors (e.g., repetition, sequences).  

**2. Transaction Deanon Engine**  
- Chainalysis-style clustering for BTC/ETH/XRPL wallets.  
- Cross-exchange address tagging via simulated API scraping.  

**3. Smart Contract Exploit Scanner**  
- Detects reentrancy, integer overflow, and approval vulnerabilities.  
- ERC-20/ERC-721/BEP-20 contract analysis with attack simulations.  

**4. Hardware Wallet Attack Vectors**  
- Cold storage attack playbook:  
  - Fault injection emulation (voltage glitching).  
  - Side-channel signal analysis (power/timing).
